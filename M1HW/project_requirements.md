## Tier Grading
We will use a Bronze/Silver/Gold tier system, where Bronze gives a maximum of 80 points, SIlver, a maximum of 90, and Gold up to 100. I recommend you always complete one tier before adding the functionality for later tiers.

### Bronze (80/100)
- The program should allow the user to  add or subtract two numbers.
- The program should also allow the user to divide or multiply two numbers.

### Silver (90/100)
- For this tier, the program should work in a way that roughly matches the behavior displayed in the sample output below. You may have to make some assumptions.
- In addition, the program should be written in such a way that a given function either handles user input/output, OR does calculations. (No one function can do both).
- (In other words, your UI code should call special functions to do the calculations.)

### Gold (100/100)
- For this tier, the program should be written in such a way that a given class or module either handles user input/output, OR does calculations.
- In other words, similar to the Silver requirements, but broken into two or more classes or modules.
